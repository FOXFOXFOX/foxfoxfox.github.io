Hi, my name is Kaitlin Flynn and I'm a junior postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Pat Schloss at the University of Michigan Medical School. I recieved my Ph.D. from UMMS in May of 2015 working in the laboratory of Michele Swanson. In my thesis work, I studied antibiotic resistance and evolution of the pathogen *Legionella pneumophila*. This work was primarily genetic engineering of bacteria and infecting my one mutant bacteria into one host cell. For my postdoctoral work, I joined Pat's lab and have jumped into microbial ecology and microbiome analysis. This work is both awesome and intimidating. In contrast to the last 5 years, my new research project involves considering a community of several types of bacteria interacting with a much more complex host (a human or a mouse). Not only that, there are several new sequencing technologies and data analysis pipelines that I'm learning! I hope this blog will someday be a resource or just encouragement for anyone starting to explore this exciting new field :) 

The blog is titled "Move fast and break things", a slogan pinched from the Facebook corporation. They have this on posters all over their offices and the message is that in order to innovate fast and on a large scale, you must be working so hard/quickly that things break. I've applied this to learning new things in my postdoc lab, and definitely have plenty of things I;ve broken along the way.
