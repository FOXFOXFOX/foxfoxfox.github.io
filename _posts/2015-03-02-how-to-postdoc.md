After finishing my Ph.D. in bacterial genetics, I changed fields into a microbiome lab and started as a postdoc in July 2015. Then my PI went on sabbatical for 6 months. Here's what happened next. 

Okay, so that's a little bit of a dramatic overstatement, but I did feel like I was (still am?) sort of stumbling my way through changing fields and I wanted to both get my Schloss lab blog off the ground and share some practical tips that helped maintain my sanity + productivity while living the lab n00b life.

So, do you find yourself starting or considering changing fields for your postdoc? I definitely recommend it! Here's a few ways I've made it work. 

*1) Make a potential list of projects or tasks to get started on*
This is easy, right? In between doing training courses and getting your bench/desk together your first week in your new lab, start looking at lab papers, lab mates projects, and what your PI has funding for to get an idea of what niche you can fill in the lab. Brainstorming is perhaps the most fun part of getting a project started, and no idea is too wacky to be left off the list. 

*2) Think about what you're good at*
You've gotten your Ph.D. by being a total badass in your field, and even though you've changed directions, certainly there are some skills that you can bring to your new lab and new project. For instance, I had experience infecting mice, culturing bacteria and genetic techniques that I used to design a project where I am infecting mice and looking at their microbiome. This way, I've built on my previous training but also been able to expand my analytical techniques by performing new-to-me experiments. 

*3) Set goals, return to them constantly*
Goal setting is pretty much the only way I can get things done in life. Whether it's "do laundry by Sunday" or "publish a paper by June", having your goals and deadlines down on paper is a surefire way to make sure you actually get them done. Now, this isn't life-changing advice for someone at our stage, but when I was feeling frustrated and less-confident in the early weeks of my postdoc, I made a list of 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month goals. Now that I'm 6 months in, I can see what progress I've made and what the next steps are (even if it doesn't empirically seem like I'm any closer to a paper by June). 

4) Write a grant proposal, or several 

5) Ask so many questions your lab mates put up Do Not Disturb signs

6) Have a softball project/paper/goal

7) Learn the language

8) Move fast and break things
