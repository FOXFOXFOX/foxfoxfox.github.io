We use blog postings as a way to maintain an electronic lab notebook in
conjunction with project-specific GitHub repositories for our bioinformatics
analyses. Each day should start with copying the template post and renaming it
to be `YYYY-MM-DD-Post_name`. The elements of the date should be separated
by dashes and in place of spaces in the blog title put underscores.
