After finishing my Ph.D. in bacterial genetics, I changed fields into a microbial ecology and microbiome lab and started as a postdoc in July 2015. Then my PI went on sabbatical for 6 months. Here's what happened next. 


Tips:

1) Make a potential list of projects or tasks to get started on

2) Think about what you're good at 

3) Set goals, return to them constantly 

4) Write a grant proposal, or several 

5) Ask so many questions your lab mates put up Do Not Disturb signs

6) Have a softball project/paper/goal

7) Learn the language

8) Move fast and break things
