After finishing my Ph.D. in bacterial genetics, I changed fields into a microbiome lab and started as a postdoc in July 2015. Then my PI went on sabbatical for 6 months. Here's what happened next. 

Okay, so that's a bit of a dramatic lead-in, but I did feel like I was (still am?) sort of stumbling my way through changing fields and I wanted to both get my Schloss lab blog off the ground and share some practical tips that helped maintain my sanity + productivity while living the lab n00b life.

So, if you find yourself considering changing fields for your postdoc, what should you do? Starting in a new field after previously feeling like an expert (in your thesis work) can be stressful, exhausting, and hard to maintain motivation + confidence. Here's a few things that helped me stay confident and on-task as I transitioned.  

**1) Make a potential list of projects or tasks to get started on**

This is easy, right? In between doing training courses and getting your bench/desk together your first week in your new lab, start looking at lab papers, lab mates projects, and what your PI has funding for to get an idea of what niche you can fill in the lab. Brainstorming is perhaps the most fun part of getting a project started, and no idea is too wacky to be left off the list. 

**2) Think about what you're good at**

You've gotten your Ph.D. by being a total badass in your field, and even though you've changed directions, certainly there are some skills that you can bring to your new lab and new project. For instance, I had experience infecting mice, culturing bacteria and genetic techniques that I used to design a project where I am infecting mice and looking at their microbiome. This way, I've built on my previous training but also been able to expand my analytical techniques by performing new-to-me experiments. 

**3) Set goals, return to them constantly**

Goal setting is pretty much the only way I can get things done in life. Whether it's "do laundry by Sunday" or "publish a paper by June", having your goals and deadlines down on paper is a surefire way to make sure you actually get them done. Now, this isn't life-changing advice for someone at our stage, but when I was feeling frustrated and less-confident in the early weeks of my postdoc, I made a list of 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month goals. Now that I'm 6 months in, I can see what progress I've made and what the next steps are (even if it doesn't empirically seem like I'm any closer to a paper by June). 

**4) Write a grant proposal, or several** 

David Baltrus on Twitter recently asked "I don't know why all PDs aren't motivated to write an NRSA before starting." I cheekily replied that this was because we are busy writing our theses before starting a postdoc appoinment. I stand by that reply, but I also see his point that writing a grant proposal, whether you submit it or not, is an excellent way to get started thinking deeply about your project. After coming up with a few ideas in step 1 and talking them over with your advisor or lab mates, the next best thing to do (I think, and this is my blog so I can tell you what to do) is to write something more formal. Look for funding opportunities, yes, but the process of diving into the literature, exploring methods and wrestling with aims is incredibly valuable for setting you up for a successful postdoc in your new field. In particular, you'll want to get as much feedback as possible from experts around you. Plus, once it's complete, you'll have a solid document to submit to any number of fellowship applications! 

**5) Ask so many questions your lab mates put up Do Not Disturb signs**

This is huge. You're probably not in science if you don't like to ask questions, but with Pat away (phsyically, he was usually available online) my best brainstorming came from the senior graduate students in the lab. Beyond brainstorming, starting in a new field brings all sorts of troubleshooting and technique challenges you probably haven't struggled with before. Even further, moving into bioinformatics and statistical analysis added another layer of complexity for me and has resulted in constant code questions being fired from me to my lab mates over Slack, on the weekend, at night, etc. If your lab is awesome like mine, these lovely folks will help you without complaint over and over again. 

**6) Have a softball project/paper/goal**

A key way to maintain confidence while starting something new is to have very small achievable goals that will provide small wins for you every day. For instance, if you're training to run a marathon, you're probably going to start with just running 2 or 3 miles a day, something most active people can manage. Apply the same principle to starting in your new lab. For me, I am relatively comfortable writing and so after writing my grant proposal, I realized there was a lack of synthesized information on a particular topic of my project. I decided to write a short minireview/opinion article on it. This gave me a task to dig into that I felt comfortable in, and helped boost my confidence in the lab going forward. What small things can you do to feel powerful in your new position? 

**7) Learn the language**

In science and technology, each field has it's own esoteric language and terms. For our lab, my first month I had no idea what contigs, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, PCOA, Shannon diversity, PhiX runs, etc etc even meant. And it can be really hard to sit down with a dictionary and google each term (I actually did this) you don't understand and really understand what they mean. Much like a foreign language, immersion is the most efficient way to go about learning the new terms. Try going to seminars with words you don't understand in the title, evesdropping on your labmates troubleshooting (ha!), reading review papers in new topics or (for me) just going to the PLOS Comp Bio website and poking around. The more you stick with it, the sooner you'll be constructing sentences using words you didn't know existed 6 months ago. And don't forget, you can always ask what something means if you don't know (see #5)

**8) Move fast and break things**

Finally, my favorite motto (and title of this blog) is the Facebook company directive to "Move fast and break things". This doesn't mean, run through your lab like a bull in a china shop. Rather, the phrase is meant to invoke the idea that when working in an innovative environment you should be developing and thinking and experimenting so quickly that stuff falls apart or gets left behind. A postdoc is a short but intense period of training, and you want to get the most of it while picking up these new skills. I encourage you to move quickly, try new experiments, forget controls (ok, I don't encourage this), accidentally drop your mice on the floor (kidding again), and not to be afraid to break something in the process. Because it is in failed experiments we often learn the most :) 

I hope some of these tips give you structure moving forward in your new postdoctoral position! I'm only 6 months in, so I can't yet tell how successful this plan has made me but I do know that I feel confident and excited to come to lab every day to research in my new field.
