We use blog postings as a way to maintain an electronic lab notebook in
conjunction with project-specific GitHub repositories for our bioinformatics
analyses. The idea of these blog posts is to provide a record of your  daily
goals, what you accomplished, what you learned, and how you went about it. These
blog posts are comment enabled to allow for collaboration between people in the
lab and Pat. People that fail to update their blog notebook regularly will be
publicly flogged.

We have started to create various templates for different types of blog
posts in the `_post_templates` folder. To start a new post, you will usually
copy one of those templates to the `_posts` or `_knitr` folders and rename it to
be `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title`. The elements of the date should be separated by
dashes and in place of spaces in the blog title put dashes as well. These posts
are written in markdown, which is a pretty easy to learn formatting method.

Each blog post will also have a comment window at the bottom. The goal is to
enable your colleagues and Pat to comment on your work, ask questions, make
to-do lists, etc.
